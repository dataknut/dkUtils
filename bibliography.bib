abstract="Misinterpretation and abuse of statistical tests, confidence intervals, and statistical power have been decried for decades, yet remain rampant. A key problem is that there are no interpretations of these concepts that are at once simple, intuitive, correct, and foolproof. Instead, correct use and interpretation of these statistics requires an attention to detail which seems to tax the patience of working scientists. This high cognitive demand has led to an epidemic of shortcut definitions and interpretations that are simply wrong, sometimes disastrously so---and yet these misinterpretations dominate much of the scientific literature. In light of this problem, we provide definitions and a discussion of basic statistics that are more general and critical than typically found in traditional introductory expositions. Our goal is to provide a resource for instructors, researchers, and consumers of statistics whose knowledge of statistical theory and technique may be limited but who wish to avoid and spot misinterpretations. We emphasize how violation of often unstated analysis protocols (such as selecting analyses for presentation based on the P values they produce) can lead to small P values even if the declared test hypothesis is correct, and can lead to large P values even if that hypothesis is incorrect. We then provide an explanatory list of 25 misinterpretations of P values, confidence intervals, and power. We conclude with guidelines for improving statistical interpretation and reporting.",

	abstract = {Carbon dioxide emissions from the higher education sector are globally significant. This study compares the performance of 20 institutions in English research-intensive universities to their self-set targets, using three key performance indicators. Emissions increased for all but two institutions and consequently, targets are extremely ambitious and almost certainly unachievable. Observations are supported by a 10-point appraisal that measures the environmental value of each carbon management plan and a ‘reality check’ equation to classify them as either pragmatic or ambitious. A paradox is highlighted: institutions that set realistic but relatively low targets can be penalised in league tables and lambasted for apparent lack of ambition even when they may be more likely to succeed in delivering environmental improvements. The results of a staff and student questionnaire at the University of Southampton suggest that increasing awareness on impacts of energy usage will promote a cultural shift towards becoming more energy efficient to reduce emissions. Current carbon management plans are not a good indicator of future performance. The English higher education sector has underestimated the challenge of carbon emissions reduction. Pledged targets seem unlikely to be met by English universities and the likely environmental costs may jeopardise the global competitiveness of the sector. Methods for assessing Scope 3 emissions need refining and standardizing, given they are likely to be the most significant portion of a typical university’s carbon footprint. The use of appropriate key performance indicators to foster action and promote realistic target-setting is required at sector-level to achieve the 2020 goal.},

	abstract = {Organisations of all types are significant contributors to international greenhouse gas emissions. The business case for supporting low-carbon practices is gathering pace, alongside the regulatory demands imposed through carbon emission compliance reporting. Despite this, guidance for generating carbon footprints through hybrid environmentally extended input-output analysis is under-developed and under-researched. Higher Education Institutions are key components of education systems across the globe, transcending international borders, socio-political regimes and economic systems. As an internationally significant sector beginning to address climate issues through carbon reduction policies on and off the estate, very few research articles have been published that document emissions arising from all directly and indirectly attributable activities. This study outlines a number of key elements to standardise the organisational carbon footprinting process by reconciling and evaluating the methodological steps in six selected internationally reputable guidelines (published by the Global Reporting Initiative, the Carbon Disclosure Project, the United Kingdom's Government Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, the International Standardisation Organisation and the Higher Education Funding Council for England). A systematic review is undertaken which relates the four principles of carbon footprinting (boundary-setting, identification of activities, collecting of data and reporting/verification) to the academic literature. Then, via consultation with university environment managers, a number of recommendations are made to address and improve i) the potential to avoid double-counting, ii) the financial and resource cost of carbon footprinting and iii) the reliability and comparability of data compiled by institutions. We introduce a methodology for a universal, standardised footprinting standard for higher education (that could also apply to all organisations regardless of sector or region) with cut-off criteria that excludes paid-for products and services typically included in the ‘Scope 3’ proportion of the footprint. In proposing this methodology, carbon footprinting is made more applicable to higher education institutions (since existing standards are designed for generality and for profit-driven organisations) and the practical issues, associated with externally owned data and non-expert staff, are broadly overcome.},
